# Processed

## Materials

* Day-to-day timeline for the three weeks
* A sheet with examples, key facts, and visual analogs for each concept,
  including problem solving and presentations (targetted for the student)
* Update energizers list (in Google Docs) with Jonathan's energizers
* Phaser example-like examples for every concept we teach (ex. build a "Phaser
  example" for using input fields in a form)
* c9.io auto-code reloader that shows an index
* Phaser bootstrap template
* Web development bootstrap template
* Cheatsheet on using GitHub
* Firebase example
* Firebase cheatsheet
* Bullet points guideliens for running kinesthetic (for us)
    * CS-Unplugged (research this)
    * PB&J
    * Trust Robot

## Swag

* T-Shirts
* Stickers
* Lasercut graduation gifts
* Buttons
* Socks

## Results (what we want people coming out of the camp to know)

### Understanding of Web Development

* HTML
    * HTML Tags
    * HTML Attributes
    * Parent/child sibling
* CSS
    * CSS Selectors
    * CSS Cascade
* DOM Manipulation
    * On ____ callbacks
* A web framework (React, Angular, Backbone, etc)
* Phaser
    * Physics

### Understanding of Fundamentals

* Variables
* Computational thinking (includes understanding programs run in order)
* Objects
* Arrays
* Callbacks
* Functions
* Loops
* Promises
* Conditionals

### Problem Solving Skills

* Breaking down the problem
* Google skills

### Change in Mindset

* Resiliancy to failure
* Growth mindset
* Autonomy

### Deliverables (tangible things)

* Frontend-only webapp (no backend/Firebase/etc)
* Frontend webapp with backend
* Backend of a webapp (like Flask)
* Phaser with user input
* Given a formal short presentation of what they've built
* Given a lightning talk on a topic that's not their project
* Presented project at a end-of-camp demo day
* Presented project at a end-of-summer (with other cohorts) demo day
* Letter to self & goals
* Web portfolio of projects

## Metrics

* Measure delta of grit and mindset between before and after camp
* Measure delta of self-efficacy between before and after camp
* Create assessment for student deliverables
    * Like a rubric?
    * Self-assessment
* Create assessment coding knowledge on-demand
    * Self-assessment
    * Coding tests
* In-person one-on-one meeting with students
* Informal in-person class (as a whole) feedback
