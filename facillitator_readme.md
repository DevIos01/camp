# Presentation Tips

## How to demo (a presentation)

To show students what not to do in a presentation, show them a bad
presentation. Run through a presentation with each of the following errors and
ask them what you did wrong in each of the following examples.

After doing each of these have the hackers suggests what you could have done
better, then demonstrate their suggestions. Repitition is key here, so do each
example even if it seems similar to another example.

Presenting anything:

1. Talk with no reference to your visual open (just the code).
1. Talk with your demo open but you don't reference anything onscreen.
1. Referencing things without pointing to them with your mouse.
1. Referencing things without using it or modifying it.

For example, when explaining how login works, instead of having just the
dashboard open and then saying "when the user clicked on login before, the code
in the backend that validates that the user exists, note the importance of this
line, and then it goes into the dashboard"

Presenting code:

1. Talk about how useful a piece of code is without pointing to it.
1. Referencing your code without any code open.
1. Referencing a specific piece of code with the code open but without that
   code being on screen.
1. Referencing a specific line of code without pointing to it.
1. Use the mouse pointer to point to what you say you changed but don't change
   anything.

## Tips

Tips for students before their first demoing session:

- Show, don't tell
  - For example, if you're talking about your website, that website better be
    open.
- Make sure there is always something pointing (mouse pointer, finger, stick)
  to whatever you are referencing.
- However, if you're talking about the button in the signup form of the
  website, not only must you have the signup URL opened, you must also have the
  mouse pointing to the cursor
- You matter. People want to hear you. Speak up!
- Give context to what and why you are presenting.
- Open all tabs you want to show ahead of time.
- Visual aids can help you remember your place (the cursor pointing to what you
  are doing can help you keep track of where you are).
- Change / write your code so that the viewer can see the before and after.

### [Hacking the Internet](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cBO7QCZ6Jeh73hWqHB-4XqBkGxT7uUMyJM9ptlvVxow/edit#slide=id.ga1ddc30a6_1_8)

1. Tell hackers they will 'Hack the Internet'
1. "Yes Let's" session (5 minutes) (entire activity takes 5 minutes- session is
   probably 2 1/2 minutes)
  1. Explain that the goal of this exercise is to prep for brainstorming
     mindset.
  1. Demonstrate activity with another facuilitator.
  1. Facilitator goes around to each pair and passivley monitors and only
     engages (assures them there is no wrong answer) sparingly (if a pair is not
     active for 10+ seconds).
  1. Pairs present their outcomes.
1. Start working through [Hacking the Internet](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cBO7QCZ6Jeh73hWqHB-4XqBkGxT7uUMyJM9ptlvVxow/edit#slide=id.ga1ddc30a6_1_8).
  - Explicitly have students follow along.
  - Have co-facuilitator go between hackers and make sure everyone is caught
    up.
1. Deployment of Twitter Page to c9.io 
1. Tips for presenting and demoing
1. Students demo their hacks (I Do + We Do)

## Brainstorm Group Manifesto

1. So our goal is to make hack camp what you want it to be.
1. At Hack Camp, we are not going to make anything mandatory.
1. However, you guys are going to spend a lot of time with each other.
1. Let's make that experience what you want it to be.
1. We want to give you guys the opportunity to create a manifesto that you want
   the Hack Camp to be.
  1. You guys will brainstorm what values will go into this manifesto.
1. Split into pairs (different then before)
  1. "Yes Let's" session (5 minutes)
  1. 5 minutes brainstorming
    - [EXPLAIN RULES FOR BRAINSTORMING]
  1. 5 minutes filtering
1. Figure out how to operationalize it (explain how the values of Burning Man
   are very actionable)(kipp character report card)
  1. Each team presents top 4 ideas.
  1. Group voting on the top 6 values.
  1. Take a photo of the winning sticky notes.

# Module II

- start out with an energizer that promotes team building 
- preface everything by mentioning in the morning that today we're not doing any lecturing.
- "really encouraging you guys to level-up your Google-fu, and if you're having trouble get
ting past something, you're sitting next to a bunch of people who are facing similar,
if not the same, problems."
- Then define that there'll always be at least one person in the classroom at all times.
- If they do get blocked on something, and all of them get stuck on it, we won't do an impromptu lecture. 
- We'll have a one-on-one conversation with them and help them solve the problem themselves, then they can proceed to teach everyone else.
