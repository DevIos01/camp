# Things that Galvanize has *_already_* agreed on.

## Dates

6/1 - 8-17

## Google For Entrepreneurs Space

We can use _everything_ in the Google for Entrepreneurs space, including the conference room and all of the monitors.

However, before we can comandeer any part of the space, we need to give them ample notice (informally estimated by me, Jonathan, to be more than 7 business days). This is so that they can give their members adequate notice.

hackEDU team members may also claim permanent desk space in this area, however the same 7 business day notice applies.

## Small Classroom Space (Current Classroom Space)

We have this room until August 17th. However, by Cohort 3, we will have outgrown it. Therefore, we need to ask them for a room that can properly house Cohort's 3 & 4.

## hackEDU Team Access & Keyfobs

hackEDU team members have 24/7 access to Galvanize and members of Galvanize (this is currently true for @jonleung @zachlatta @maxwofford and @andreadeng). This practically means we have keyfobs. We can ask for this priveldge for any other new hackEDu team members.

## Student Access

They may work anywhere in Galvanize space but they will not have keyfob access.

## Other Amenities

- Without much difficulty, Galvanize can provide desks, chairs, power strips etc. Just ask any of the events team.
