# Portfolio Project Day

_Date: 07.14.15_  
_Led by [Max Wofford](https://github.com/MaxWofford)_

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Hackers will be working in their existing pairs and continuing their projects
  from yesterday
  - They are _completely welcome_ to change what they're working on
- Facilitators will be going around and checking on those pairs, should any red
  flags occur, facilitators will discuss and proceed accordingly.

## Morning Introduction

Morning preface to hacking:

We want you to be able to build your own project after camp. We got lots of
feedback that you felt very lost throughout yesterday. Today will be your day to
mess around and cement your knowledge while exploring things at your own pace. I
also want to recognize that it is hard to navigate all of this with just your
partner. Reach out to other groups and try to find a question that noone can
find the answer to. We'll always be here if you absolutely need help, but
exercising until it hurts builds up your mental strength.
