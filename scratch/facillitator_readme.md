## High Level Outline

# Guiding Principals
https://github.com/hackedu/hack-camp/blob/master/cohort_2/requirements_for_labs.md

Module

Functions
-  to encapsulate a set of actions (no output)
	-  with inputs
	-  without inputs
-  to compute an output
	-  with inputs
-  both

## 1. HTML + CSS 
## 2. Turtle Blocks => JS (debugger, funcs (actions + calculating outputs), loops, variables) => Googlable Web Dev? / Maestro (debugger, funcs (actions + calculating outputs), loops,

	1. computers can only do thing in order
	2. computers can remember things
	3. computers can do things over and over again
	4. computers can choose to do one thing or another thing
	5. computers can do something when something else happens

## 3. PencilCode



Blockley Draw
- draw the thing
- draw thing that is of variable size (variable)
- name the thing (action function)
	- draw the thing a couple of times
- draw the thing many times (loop)

Drawings


Formalization of concepts
- you have been calling a function
- you have made a function and called it
- inputs
- actions
- none of these things have outputs
- variables point to things, here is how we are going to draw them


Make another shape
- as they explore go around to each student and formalize the concepts with them

Let's look at functions that have outputs

Then try to understand Functions with Inputs

- do a thing

Blockley Todo
- reset canvas
- make it step through the function slower
- documentation
- makeColor(r, g, b)


Outputting Function:
I Do:
Calculate Tax

You Do:
Calculate Tip

I Do:
Calculate Tip + Tax

You Do:

You Do:
Google Exercise
- Derive the Random Function with Googling

Puts this in







## Presentation Tips
- Presenting this to students
	1. Talk with no reference to your visual open (just the code)
		1. Ask them what's wrong
	1. Now fix the above error by talk with your demo open but you don't reference anything
		3. Ask them what's wrong
	3. Now fix the above error but Referencing things without pointing to it
		4. Ask them what's wrong
	5. When when you're presenting code
		6. Talk about how useful a piece of code is without pointing to it
			4. Use a pointer to point to what you changed (but don't show how useful it was but don't change anything
		5. Ask them what's wrong
	5. After doing 1-4, change your code so that people can see the change.
		6. Ask them what's wrong

- Tips
	- Show don't tell
		- "Make sure there is always something pointing to whatever you are referencing.
			- For example, if you're talking about your website, that website better be open
			- However, if you're talking about the button in the signup form of the website, not only must you have the signup URL opened, you must also have the mouse pointing to the cursor"
	- You matter. People want to hear you. Speak up!
	- Give context to why and what you are presenting.
	- Open all tabs you want to show ahead of time
	- Visual Aid Skills
		- Use your cursor to point
		- Change / write your code so that the viewer can see the before and after
			- make sure the display is present during this.

	- So our goal is to make hack camp what you want it to be.
	- At Hack Camp, we are not going to make anything mandatory.
	- However, you guys are going to spend a lot of time with each other
	- Let's make that experience awesome
	- We want to give you guys the opportunity to create a manifesto that you want everyone at hack camp to abide by
	- You guys will brainstorm what values will go into this manifesto
	- split into 2 teams (2 teams of 2 and 3)

## Module II

Drawing in Blockley
- make sure there is a clear function
- 

```js
function colour_random() {
  var num = Math.floor(Math.random() * Math.pow(2, 24));
  return '#' + ('00000' + num.toString(16)).substr(-6);
}

for(var i=0; i<1000; i++) {
    Turtle.moveForward(i);
    Turtle.turnRight(192);
    var color = colour_random();
    
    if (i % 92 === 0) {
        Turtle.penColour(color);
    }
}
```







- start out with an energizer that promotes team building 
- preface everything by mentioning in the morning that today we're not doing any lecturing.
	- "really encouraging you guys to level-up your Google-fu, and if you're having trouble get
	   ting past something, you're sitting next to a bunch of people who are facing similar,
	   if not the same, problems."
	- Then define that there'll always be at least one person in the classroom at all times.
	- If they do get blocked on something, and all of them get stuck on it, we won't do an impromptu lecture. 
- We'll have a one-on-one conversation with them and help them solve the problem themselves, then they can proceed to teach everyone else.
