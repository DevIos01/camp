- This is a time for you (the student) to bring up anything, code, feelings, your future career, anything.

### Staggering One on one Timing

- jonathan

- max

We want at least 1 facillitator in the room at any given time. Jonathan will take the first shift, then andrea, and then when Jonathan comes back, max will go do his on on ones.

One on ones are 15 - 20 minutes each.
