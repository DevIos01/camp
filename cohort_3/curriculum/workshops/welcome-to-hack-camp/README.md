Outline:

- Welcome to Hack Camp! We're so excited to have you here.
- Hack Camp is a safe place. For everyone.
    - If you have any comments/questions/concerns, please either grab me
      personally, text me, or email me. I'll send all of you my contact info
      during the first workshop. We'll also be making an anonymous form for
      sharing any misconduct.
- This is going to be hard and you're going to learn a lot, no matter what skill
  level you're currently at. Don't worry if you feel behind or if you feel
  stuck - we're here to help you through that.
- #1 piece of advice - **ask questions**. The best programmers I personally
  know, who work at the best companies (Google, Facebook, the best
  startups), ask a _lot_ of questions. If you have any hesitation as to whether
  you should ask a question or not, ask it. The best way to learn is to ask a
  lot of questions and the people who have previously gotten the most out of
  Hack Camp have asked the most questions.
- We'll be following a series of workshops that'll cover the basics of web
  development, but please treat us as a resource going forward. We're here
  to be helpful in any way we can.
- Schedule
    - Workshops every other day
    - Projects between workshops, demoing every day workshops aren't done
    - We'll be covering the essentials of web development. We encourage you to
      follow along during the workshops, but also welcome to do your own thing.
      If you already have some coding experience and know what we're covering
      in, you're still welcome to follow along (or not!).
