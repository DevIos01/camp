# Feedback

Hacker feedback has been transferred here from our internal Google Sheet. For
those on the hackEDU team, you can access the original spreadsheet
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rimHTE_2VaAeXalkIIGWQcX1MfZ3Lvvc-PUPKLGp6QM/edit).

The row number of the feedback corresponds to markdown file named with the same
number. If there's a missing markdown file here, that means the hacker elected
to not share their feedback.
