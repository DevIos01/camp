# Frosty Silence

## What was your favorite part of running Hack Camp?

My favorite part about running Hack Camp was definitely watching hackers
actually ship projects after just a day or two. The amount of growth they made
in such a short amount of time was absolutely astounding.

## What is one thing that you did while running Hack Camp that you were proud of?

We managed to, in just two weeks, create a community of people who are not only
actively trying to learn and build things, but help each other, as well.

## What really stood out to you about Hack Camp?

Although everything was very condensed, only two weeks, the effect it had on
those that attended was that of an extensive program.

## What takeaways did you have from running Hack Camp?

There's always so much to learn! This can refer to anything from code problems,
to finding games that'll keep everyone pumped. Keeping an open mind and being
receptive to criticism is key.

## Would you recommend other hackers to run Hack Camp in the future? Why or why not?

Definitely! Personally, I feel like I came out of those two weeks with a family.
It helped me learn a lot about not only learning/teaching people how to code,
but also how to create lasting, meaningful communities.

## Is there anything that you'd like to add?

Hack Camp was AMAZING. Two weeks of my life that I'll always remember.

# Dry Paper

## What was your favorite part of running Hack Camp?

Being able to bond with the participants. Not many camps have that sort of
environment, where there is real bonding that happens. This mainly happened
towards the end of camp.

## What is one thing that you did while running Hack Camp that you were proud of?

Being able to help people out with their code, even though I didn't always
necessarily know the underlying concepts.

## What really stood out to you about Hack Camp?

The environment that was set. During the first two cohorts it was set to be a
very safe, fun environment. We tried to reflect that same environment when we
were running Hack Camp and it was great to see that created, even though we were
running it.

## What takeaways did you have from running Hack Camp?

Mainly how to lead people and how to utilize the resources around you to help
people with something new that you haven't necessarily encountered.

## Would you recommend other hackers to run Hack Camp in the future? Why or why not?

It really depends on how they're able to lead people and their ability to
interact with other people. There's a specific type of person to lead Hack Camp.
I think it'd be hard for some people to lead without the necessary
qualifications.

## Is there anything that you'd like to add?

Have a general background in knowing how to code. If you don't know how to code,
it may be difficult for you to help people learn.

# Twilight Pine

## What was your favorite part of running Hack Camp?

Interacting with all the students and enjoying teaching them how to learn about
programming, especially the people who have never programmed before. I think
that was very nice and I really enjoyed it a lot. Also, working on a team and
having everyone working on something and everyone working to improve the
experience for the hackers.

## What is one thing that you did while running Hack Camp that you were proud of?

One thing I was proud of that I did during Hack Camp was interacting with the
new students and building a relationship with them. Although these relationships
weren't completely related to programming, I was able to build a bond and be
friendly.

## What really stood out to you about Hack Camp?

What stood out for me at Hack Camp was working with hackEDU and the whole team
to improve the experience for every hacker. Especially working with Gemma,
Selynna, and Max to make the camp as good as possible for every hacker.

## What takeaways did you have from running Hack Camp?

One takeaway I had from running Hack Camp was how important it is to build a
relationship with the hackers. Even though they have very different skill
levels, it is very nice to find out that they enjoyed what you have done. I
think I have learned a lot about working on a team to build a great experience
for the hackers.

## Would you recommend other hackers to run Hack Camp in the future? Why or why not?

Yes, I would definitely, especially if they're going to teach in the future
(which they probably will). We did not run the camp as programmers -- we did not
write a lot of code -- but what really mattered was learning to control people
with a variety of skill levels and accommodate for all of them. We didn't want
anyone to be outside of the circle in Hack Camp.

## Is there anything that you'd like to add?

The best thing about Hack Camp is how everyone separated work from the
relationships that were created.
