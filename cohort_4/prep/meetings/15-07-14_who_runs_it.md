# Who is going to run cohort 4?

_In attendance:_

- Andrea Deng <andrea@hackedu.us>
- Jonathan Leung <jonathan@hackedu.us>
- Max Wofford <max@hackedu.us>
- Zach Latta <zach@zachlatta.com>

Gemma.

- Should we have a second leader? Yes.
  - Perhaps we should include Gemma in the discussion.
  - Perhaps us (Andrea, Jonathan, Max, and Zach) could pretend to be students in
    the next cohort
  - Perhaps Gemma could find the second leader (to reproduce working with
    someone a club leader kind of knows)
