# If We Run Code In The Dark, Hackers Will Be More Energized

## Implementation

Organizers will run a Code in the Dark session in place of a morning energizer.

## Observations

- Hackers gave positive feedback about the Code in the Dark session.
- Hackers were less energetic throughout the day.
- Many hackers were distracted throughout the day.
- Some hackers asked for physical energizers in their feedback forms.

## Conclusions

The hypothesis is not supported by the observations. Hackers did enjoy the activity, but it didn't energize them. In the future Code in the Dark sessions won't replace energizers -- instead they'll be an extra activity run during the day.
